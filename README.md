## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to centralize all **board game libraries (ludothÃ¨ques)**, game centers, and other locations in France that offer **board games for rent**.  
The main goal is to allow users to **find where a specific game is available**, since no single library owns all existing games.
